### Syntax

- Select a element by typing the element then opening and closing brackets
- Inside the brackets you type the property you want to change followed by a colon then the value you want to set and finally a semi colon

> h1 {
    color: red;
}

### Adding CSS to a project

- To add it externally you create a .css file and include `<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">` inside the &lt;head> of your css
- To add it internally you can put all of your css inside a &lt;style> tag in the &lt;head> of your html file
- To add it inline add a style attribute to whatever element you want to change and put the css inside of it
