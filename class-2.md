## Text editors

#### Features to look out for when choosing a text editor
- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Variety of themes
- Plugins that suit your needs

#### What these features do
- Code completion lets you start typing and the editor you are using will guess what you're typing and try to finish it for you.
- Syntax highlighting changes the color of certain parts of your code. For example a HTML tag will be a different color than a attribute inside a tag.
- A variety of themes will help make your text editor more visually pleasing to look at or in some cases less straining on the eyes.
