## Control Flow

- The control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a script

## Functions in JS

- A function is a piece of code that can be called to perform a task
- Ex: Instead of telling someone to grab a rag, put water on it, rub it on the wall up and down, you can just tell them to wash the wall.
- Ex: `function sayHello(){put code in here}` then you can call this function at anytime using `sayHello()`

## JS Operators

- ** Exponent
- % Modulus
