## CSS Flexbox

- Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
  - Displaying things horizontally and not up and down (y-axis)
- Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
  - The main axis is the axis the elements move on (x or y) and the cross is just the opposite of whatever the main is on
- How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
  - Changing things in a visual way but not logically in the html structure can make certain screen readers read in the wrong order

- What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
  - Vertically centering, making things take equal space, making things same height regardless of content
- How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
  - I need to master this topic in order to make good responsive websites that flow well and look good.
