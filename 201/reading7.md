## Domain Modeling

- Explain why we need domain modeling.
    - We need this as a easy and clean way to store objects with similar data and manipulate them in similar ways

## HTML Table Basics

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
    - Tables are only made to hold tabular data and will not look correct or work correctly with other data.
- List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.
    - `<table>` itself is semantic and creates a table
    - `<th>` is semantic and creates labels for the data that go before them
    - `<tr>` is a container for all elements in that 1 row
    - `<col>` is a container for all elements in that 1 column

## Constructors

- What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
    - A constructor lets you reuse code for objects, so you don't have to keep typing all the variables and functions
      out.
- How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
    - The term this does not differ

## Prototypes

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
    - Prototype is like a static variable method in Java. Inheritance allows you to create a sort of child class from a
      parent class and use all the old functions while adding new ones.
