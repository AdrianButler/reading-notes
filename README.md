### Growth Mindset -

#### What is a growth mindset?

To me, a growth mindset is understanding that everyone learning a skill started from 0. No one woke up and could play guitar, fix a car, code, etc... Every skill can be learned and improved aslong as you continue working on it.

#### Reminders to keep me in a growth mindset.
1. **EVERYONE** starts from zero when learning.
2. There is nothing that can't be learned with enough persistence.
3. If you're being challenged you're learning.

### Markdown -

#### Headings
- To create a heading with MD you use a # symbol. It's very similiar to an html h tag because the number of #'s indicates the header number. for example # = &lt;h1>, ### =  &lt;h3>, ###### = &lt;h6>, etc...
- Aslong as you have two headings Github will create a table of contents to the left of the file name, which you can click to navigate the file.

#### How to Text Style
**Bold** - Put double asterisks before and after text.
