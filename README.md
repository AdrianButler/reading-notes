### Growth Mindset -

#### What is a growth mindset?

To me, a growth mindset is understanding that everyone learning a skill started from 0. No one woke up and could play guitar, fix a car, code, etc... Every skill can be learned and improved aslong as you continue working on it.

#### Reminders to keep me in a growth mindset.
1. **EVERYONE** starts from zero when learning.
2. There is nothing that can't be learned with enough persistence.
3. If you're being challenged you're learning.
