# About me

My name is Adrian(he/him), I am in Oklahoma City, OK. My goal with this class is to land a backend or maybe mobile developer job. I have been programming for a few years but never touched web development until a few months ago. I just graduated high school recently and am very excited to learn about programming and enter a programming career.
