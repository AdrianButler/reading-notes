# Class 1 Reading Notes

### Growth Mindset -

#### What is a growth mindset?

To me, a growth mindset is understanding that everyone learning a skill started from 0. No one woke up and could play a guitar, fix a car, code, etc... Every skill can be learned and improved aslong as you continue working on it.

#### Reminders to keep me in a growth mindset.
1. **EVERYONE** starts from zero when learning.
2. There is nothing that can't be learned with enough persistence.
3. If you're being challenged you're learning.

### Markdown -

#### Headings
- To create a heading with MD you use a # symbol. It's very similiar to an html h tag because the number of #'s indicates the header number. for example # = &lt;h1>, ### =  &lt;h3>, ###### = &lt;h6>, etc...
- Aslong as you have two headings Github will create a table of contents to the left of the file name, which you can click to navigate the file.

#### How to Style Text
- **Bold** - Put double asterisks(\**) before and after text.
- *Italic* - Put a single asterisk(\*) before and after text.
- ~~Strikethrough~~ - Put double tildes(\~~) around the text.
- ***Bold and italic*** - Put three astericks(\*\*\*) before and after the text. 
- <sub>Subscript</sub> - Use &lt;sub> tag before text and close the sub tag(&lt;/sub>) after the text.
- <sup>Superscript</sup> - Use &lt;sup> tag before text and close the sup tag(&lt;/sup>) after the text.

#### Quoting
- You can quote text with a > symbol right before the quote
> this text is a quote

- You can quote code with single back ticks (\`)
  - This command is quoted -> `git commit`

#### Links
- You can create a hyperlink by wrapping the text in brackets([]) and then immediately that wrap the url in parentheses.
  - Ex: \[Example hyperlink](https:/[]()/www[]().google.[]()com/) = [Example hyperlink](https://www.google.com/)
- You can also link to another section in your file by hovering over a heading and copying the link then inserting it using the method above or just plain pasting it
- To link to another file you just use the first method to create a hyperlink and instead of a url just put the path of the file you want to link to.
  - Ex: \[Example link]()
