# Class 1 Reading Notes

### Growth Mindset -

#### What is a growth mindset?

To me, a growth mindset is understanding that everyone learning a skill started from 0. No one woke up and could play a guitar, fix a car, code, etc... Every skill can be learned and improved aslong as you continue working on it.

#### Reminders to keep me in a growth mindset.
1. **EVERYONE** starts from zero when learning.
2. There is nothing that can't be learned with enough persistence.
3. If you're being challenged you're learning.

### Markdown -

#### Headings
- To create a heading with MD you use a # symbol. It's very similiar to an html h tag because the number of #'s indicates the header number. for example # = &lt;h1>, ### =  &lt;h3>, ###### = &lt;h6>, etc...
- Aslong as you have two headings Github will create a table of contents to the left of the file name, which you can click to navigate the file.

#### How to Style Text
- **Bold** - Put double asterisks(\**) before and after text.
- *Italic* - Put a single asterisk(\*) before and after text.
- ~~Strikethrough~~ - Put double tildes(\~~) around the text.
- ***Bold and italic*** - Put three astericks(\*\*\*) before and after the text. 
- <sub>Subscript</sub> - Use &lt;sub> tag before text and close the sub tag(&lt;/sub>) after the text.
- <sup>Superscript</sup> - Use &lt;sup> tag before text and close the sup tag(&lt;/sup>) after the text.

#### Quoting
- You can quote text with a > symbol right before the quote
> this text is a quote

- You can quote code with single back ticks (\`)
  - This command is quoted -> `git commit`

#### Links
- You can create a hyperlink by wrapping the text in brackets([]) and then immediately that wrap the url in parentheses.
  - Ex: \[Example hyperlink](https:/[]()/www[]().google.[]()com/) = [Example hyperlink](https://www.google.com/)
- You can also link to another section in your file by hovering over a heading and copying the link then inserting it using the method above or just plain pasting it
- To link to another file you just use the first method to create a hyperlink and instead of a url just put the path of the file you want to link to.
  - Ex: \[Example link](/class-2.md) = [Example link](/class-2.md)

#### Images
- To display an image use the same syntax as the links above except you put an exclamation mark infront of it and link to either the pictures url or source in your repo.
  - Ex: \!\[Example image](https[]()://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Test_image.jpg) results in
 ![Example image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Test_image.jpg)
 
#### Lists

- Normal lists are created by putting a - with a space following it on a new line
- You can make a numbered list with a number followed by a period and a space
  -Ex:
1. Example 1
2. Example 2
3. Example 3

- You can nest a list by placing a - after an indentation.
  - Nested list
    - Nested list in a nested list
      - Nested list in a nested list in a nested list

- You can make a task list by placing brackets after a dash.
  - Ex: - [ ] =
    - [ ] example task
  - Ex: - [x] =
    - [x] example completed task
