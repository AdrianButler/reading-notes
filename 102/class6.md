## JavaScript

### What is JavaScript

- JavaScript (JS for short) is a programming language read by the browser
- JS is single threaded, and supports OOP and functional programming.

### How to get IO in JS

- You can use document.getElementById("any_input_element").value to retrieve a value from an input element.
- You can manipulate HTML by using document.getElementById("any_element_you_want_to_add_html_to").innerHTML = "HTML goes here"

### JavaScript variables

- Variables are containers for storing data
  - Ex: `var x = 5;`
  - Ex: `var y = 10;`

- There are 4 ways to declare a variable in JS
    1. Using `var`
        - `var x = 5;`
        - If you want code to work in old browser use var
    2. Using `let`
        - `let x = 5;`
        - Use let when you think a variable can change
    3. Using `const`
        - `const x = 5;`
        - Use when a variable never changes
    4. Using nothing
        - `x = 5;`
        - Use when the variables are already declared

- Expressions can be used the same way as algebra
  - Ex: `f = (c * 9/5) + 32`

### How computers work playlist

- The 4 Computer tasks
    1. Input
    2. Storage
    3. Processing
    4. Output

- Modern computers and the first computer do/did the above 4

- Input goes to memory -> proccesor manipulates it -> stores it until its ready to be outputted

- All programming languages go back to 1s and 0s

- A bit is the storage of a 1 and 0

- Binary system has only 2 numbers

- Binary counts by multiplying by 2

- **EVERYTHING** you see on an electronic is just a bunch of 1s and 0s.

- Computers have millions of circuits that all work together

- The smaller a circuit is the faster it can work
