# Class 8

## Assignment operators

- x = function()
- x += function()
- x -= function()
- works with every math operator

## Comparison operators

- x = 3
- x == 3 returns true
- x == "3" returns true
- x == "3" returns false

- == is not strict about the type while === is

- !== is the oposite of === so it means is strictly not equal

- != means not equal
- x != 3 returns false
- x != 5 returns true

- < or > also work how they would in algebra
- x < 3 returns false
- x > 3 returns false
- x <= 3 returns true
- x > 2 returns true

## For loop

- For loops repeat an x amount of times
- for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {code goes here;}
  - this means repeat that code 10 times or until i < 10

## While loop

- While loops repeat until a condition is met
- If the condition is never met it will run forever

- while (randomColor != blue){randomColor = new randomColor();}
  - This is saying keep creating a new random color until it equals blue
