### How to make a wireframe

1. Choose how you will make your wireframe.
    - This is a personal choice but I would recommend pencil and paper over software since it's easier to start with.

2. Research your target audience and the best way to serve them content.

3. Map out the user flow.
    - How will they get from your page and where do you want them to end up?
    - How will they access x feature?

4. Sketch your wireframe.
    - Outline features.
    - Don't think about aesthetics.

5. Create your wireframe.
    - Use HTML/CSS but remember not to worry about aesthetics/colors.

6. Test

### How to make your wireframe good

- The wireframe needs to show what the purpose of the page and what the user can/should be doing.
- Everything should be organized to make it easy to navigate. Users should have confidence they can do what they came to do.
- Keep it extremely simple

## HTML Semantics

- A tag is semantic if it clearly describes its meaning.
  - &lt;footer> very clearly describes its meaning so its semantic
  - &lt;div> does not describe what it means so its not semantic
