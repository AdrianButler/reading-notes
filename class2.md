## Text editors

### Features to look out for when choosing a text editor

- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Variety of themes
- Plugins that suit your needs

### What these features do

- Code completion lets you start typing and the editor you are using will guess what you're typing and try to finish it for you.
- Syntax highlighting changes the color of certain parts of your code. For example a HTML tag will be a different color than a attribute inside a tag.
- A variety of themes will help make your text editor more visually pleasing to look at or in some cases less straining on the eyes.
- Plugins will help add custom functionality to software that maybe would have never normally been added.

### Why is it important to choose the right text editor

- Choosing the right text editor could potentially save you tons of time.
- Some text editors are harder to work with than others
- Some cost money.

- An IDE includes a compiler and a debugger and increases productivity when coding.
